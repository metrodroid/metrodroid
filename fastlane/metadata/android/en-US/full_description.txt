<p>Metrodroid can read information from some public transport NFC smartcards. It was formerly known as Farebot M.</p><p>This is a fork of Eric Butler’s Farebot project, with support for additional cards and bug fixes. A list of supported cards can be found <a href='https://github.com/metrodroid/metrodroid#supported-card-protocols' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>.</p><p>You require a NFC-compatible phone in order to read cards.</p><p>You need a NXP NFC chipset in your phone in order to read MIFARE Classic cards. Some phones have NFC chips from other manufacturers, which do not read Mifare Classic cards (eg: Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy S4). Check the About screen in the app in order to determine if your phone supports MIFARE Classic.</p><p>Some agencies have encrypted cards. You will need to acquire encryption keys in order to read them. These are generally unique to each card. Sorry, I can’t help you with this.</p><p>Some other agencies’ cards using Cubic Nextfare on Mifare Classic may also work.</p>
