    <!--
    Translators:
     * 80 character limit.

     * Used in Play Store as "Short Description".

     * "some" is used in a broad way here. Metrodroid doesn’t work with all transit networks, it
      doesn’t support all card technology that an Android device may support, and phones may not
      support certain card types (eg: MIFARE Classic).

    You may mention a local card that Metrodroid supports, if there is space, eg: "Reads information
    from some NFC smartcards for public transport, including Suica". This will help people find
    Metrodroid, but should be advertised carefully:

     * Please do not mention cards where the country does not have a single large operator (or card
       interchange system) with > 50% market share.

     * Please do not mention cards that do not have at least balance information available (eg:
       Myki) or readers that are in beta.  They can be mentioned in the full description instead.

     * Please do not mention cards if the translation is used in many countries (eg: Spanish,
       Portuguese).  However, it would be acceptable to do this for regional dialects, if no other
       condition would prohibit it.

    Examples of cards that may be mentioned here:

     1. OV-Chipkaart may be mentioned for Dutch, because it is the national system.

     2. Suica may be mentioned for Japanese, because Japan’s IC system is "Suica compatible", it is
        the largest system in Japan, and accepted on more than 50% of all networks.

    Examples of cards that should not be mentioned here:

     1. Opal should not be mentioned here, because it can only be used in Sydney. There are other
        operators in other cities in Australia where Opal cannot be used, and while it is the
        largest system, it is less than 50% of all cards in the country.

     2. Opus should not be mentioned here, because it can only be used in Québec. There are other
        operators in Canada where OPUS cannot be used. Although fr-CA is most commonly used in
        Québec, French is an official language in all of Canada.

     3. Leap should not be mentioned here, because it is in beta. Once it is out of beta, it may be
        mentioned in Irish and English (Ireland), as it is the national system of Ireland.

    If you have any questions about whether a card should be mentioned, please open an issue for it
    here: https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/issues

     * In the first sentence, "some" is used in a broad way here. Metrodroid doesn’t work with all

     * The list is in alphabetical order in English. You should make the list in alphabetical order
       in your language.
     * You may promote any local cards (appropriate for the language) to the top of this list. If
       there are multiple local cards for the language, you can promote them all to the top, and
       then keep them in alphabetical order within that list.

       For example, an fr translation (French with no dialect specified) can put Canadian and French
       cards at the top. A fr-FR translation (French in France) can put just French cards at the
       top, and an fr-CA translation (Canadian French) can put just the Canadian cards at the top.
