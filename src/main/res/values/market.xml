    <string name="market_long_desc">Metrodroid, formerly Farebot M, reads information from NFC smartcards for public transport.\n\nForked from Eric Butler\\\'s Farebot project, Metrodroid adds support for additional cards solves bugs.\n\nSupported cards:\n- Bilhete Único - São Paulo, Brazil [1] [2] [5]\n- Clipper - San Francisco, CA, USA\n- EZ-Link - Singapore [3]\n- Go card - Brisbane and South East Queensland, Australia [0] [1] [2]\n- Manly Fast Ferry - Sydney, NSW, Australia [0] [1] [2]\n- Matkakortti, HSL - Finland\n- Myki - Melbourne (and surrounds), VIC, Australia [0] [4]\n- MyWay - Australian Capital Territory, Australia [0] [1] [2]\n- NETS Flashpay - Singapore\n- Octopus - Hong Kong [0]\n- Opal - Sydney (and surrounds), NSW, Australia [0]\n- ORCA - Seattle, WA, USA\n- OV-chipkaart - Netherlands [1] [2]\n- Shenzhen Tong - Shenzong, Guangdong Province, China [0]\n- SmartRider - Western Australia, Australia [0] [1] [2]\n- Suica, IOCOA, PASMO, Edy - Japan\n- Transit Access Pass - Los Angeles, CA, USA [0] [1] [2]\n\n[0]: New in Metrodroid.\n[1]: Not compatible with all devices (MIFARE Classic).\n[2]: Encryption keys are required to read this card.\n[3]: Not compatible with all devices (CEPAS).\n[4]: Only the card number can be read.\n[5]: Fallback reader -- must be explicitly enabled in the app\\\'s preferences.\n\nYou require a NFC-compatible phone in order to read cards.\n\nYou need a NXP NFC chipset in your phone in order to read MIFARE Classic cards. Some phones have NFC chips from other manufacturers, which do not read MIFARE Classic cards (eg: Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy S4). Check the About screen in the app in order to determine if your phone supports MIFARE Classic.\n\nSome agencies have encrypted cards. You will need to acquire encryption keys in order to read them. These are generally unique to each card. Sorry, I can\\\'t help you with this.\n\nSome other agencies\\\' cards using Cubic Nextfare on MIFARE Classic may also work.\n\nFor more details about permissions required, please see the privacy policy.\n\nThis software is licensed under the GNU GPLv3+, source code is available at https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/</string>
