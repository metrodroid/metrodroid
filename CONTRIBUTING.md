## "Support my transit network"

Please see [supporting new cards](https://github.com/micolous/farebot/wiki/New-cards) on the wiki before filing.  This is a very difficult, time consuming process, involving travel to the city in question.

Your best bet is to find someone who is interested in working on this who lives in your city.

@micolous is working on Australian public transit cards first, as these are easiest for him to travel for.

## "I want to send you cards!"

I don't have the facility to accept cards right now, sorry.

If I did, I might not be able to send them back.

## "I found a bug!"

Make sure you're testing on the current version of Metrodroid (2.9.27) please check the [open issues first](https://github.com/micolous/farebot/issues) to see if it has already been reported.

Please note that some phones will not support Mifare Classic cards.  This is because Mifare Classic is not standard NFC.  You need a phone with a NXP chipset in order to read them.  The Nexus 4, 5, 6, 7 (all versions) and 10 cannot read them.  The Galaxy Neuxs, Nexus 5X and 6P can read them.

Whether your phone supports Mifare Classic is shown in the About screen.

Make sure to include all the information in the about screen when reporting.

## "I have a patch!"

You're my new best friend.  Make sure you clearly describe what the issue is and how it fixes it.

If your patch is incomplete, that's fine, just don't expect me to fix it if it requires access to a particular network's cards.

## "It says my card is encrypted!"

You'll need special hardware, and you might be able to break it.

This process isn't documented right now.  I'm currently putting together a kit for this.
